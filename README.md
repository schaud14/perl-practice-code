# perl-practice-code
Let input.txt be a file containing a sequence of strings. The strings are
separated using new lines. Write a Perl program match.pl which reads a file input.txt
and print (1) strings that contain “hi”, (2) strings that contain exact one vowel characters
(i.e. a, e, i, o, u), and (3) strings that contain two or more 'l’, and (4) strings that begin
with the letter “h” and end with the letter “t”. Assume that input.txt contains only characters
a-z.

For example, assume that input.txt is:
day
thill
helolol
hot
hotu

Output:
day contains one vowel characters
thill contains hi
hill contains two or more l
helolol contains two or more l
hot begins with h and ends with t
